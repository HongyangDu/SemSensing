## 🔧 Environment Setup

To create a new conda environment, execute the following command:

```bash
conda create --name invsems python==3.8
```

## ⚡Activate Environment

Activate the created environment with:

```bash
conda activate invsems
```

## 📦 Install Required Packages

The following packages can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-image
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
pip install opencv-python
pip install tqdm
```
Please pay attention to the torch version, according to your CUDA version. Refer to [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).


## 🏃‍♀️ Run the Program

Set the created env as the runing env:

![Set Pycharm](readme/setpycharm.png)

Run `main.py` to start the program.

## 🔍 Check the results

In this demo, we consider the encoding and decoing of wireless signal amplitude information as:

With the decoding process going, the results will be recorded:
